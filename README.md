# ‚öñÔ∏è TCP Load Balancer (.NET)

A lightweight, software-based Layer 4 TCP load balancer built in C# using .NET. This load balancer distributes incoming TCP traffic across multiple backend services, monitors their health, and removes unhealthy backends from the pool.

---

## üöÄ Features

### ‚úÖ Accepts traffic from multiple clients
- Uses an asynchronous `TcpListener` to accept and handle **concurrent TCP connections**.
- Each connection is handled in a **non-blocking Task**, allowing the load balancer to scale efficiently with multiple simultaneous clients.

### ‚úÖ Balances traffic across multiple backend services
- Implements a **pluggable backend selection strategy** via `IBackendSelector`.
- The default strategy uses **Least Connections** ‚Äî routes traffic to the backend with the fewest active connections.

### ‚úÖ Automatically removes offline services
- Background health checks (via `TcpHealthChecker`) periodically check the availability of each backend.
- Unhealthy backends are **excluded from routing decisions** until they recover.

### ‚úÖ Exponential backoff for retrying unhealthy backends
- When a backend is marked unhealthy, it is retried with an **exponential backoff delay** before it's reconsidered for health checks.
- Prevents hammering services that are temporarily down and promotes graceful recovery.

### ‚úÖ Console logging for observability
- Logs major events such as:
  - Client connections
  - Backend selection
  - Health check results (up/down)
  - Errors or exceptions
- Allows you to observe system behavior in real-time.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run Locally

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- [.NET 6 SDK or newer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### üì¶ 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TcpLoadBalancer.git
cd TcpLoadBalancer
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Configure the Backend Servers
Open Program.cs and configure the backend servers your load balancer will forward traffic to.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 3. Run the Load Balancer
From the project directory, run:
```bash
dotnet run --project TcpLoadBalancer
```

### üîÅ 4. Connect a Client
To test the connection you can simulate a client connection in another terminal using NetCat:
```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 5000
```
Type messages and see them forwarded to one of the backend servers.

If you stop one backend, the health checker will detect it as unhealthy and stop forwarding traffic to it until it recovers.
